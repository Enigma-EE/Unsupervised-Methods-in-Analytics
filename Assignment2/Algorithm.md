### K-means Based Anomaly Detection Algorithm

#### Anomaly Score Definition

Let the anomaly score for a data point \( x \) be defined as:

\[
A(x) = \frac{D(x, C_i)}{\sigma(C_i) + \epsilon} \times \rho(C_i)
\]

where:
- \( D(x, C_i) \) is the distance from the data point \( x \) to its nearest cluster center \( C_i \).
- \( \sigma(C_i) \) is the standard deviation of the distances of points in cluster \( C_i \).
- \( \epsilon \) is a small constant to avoid division by zero in cases where \( \sigma(C_i) \) is very small.
- \( \rho(C_i) \) is the density factor of cluster \( C_i \), which is inversely proportional to the number of points in \( C_i \), to adjust the score for cluster density.

A higher \( A(x) \) indicates a higher likelihood that \( x \) is an anomaly.

#### Algorithm Steps

```plaintext
Algorithm: Advanced K-means Anomaly Detection
Input: Dataset D, number of clusters k (optional), distance metric M, anomaly threshold factor α (optional)
Output: Set of anomalies A

1: Preprocess the dataset D, transform the variables and Impute the data if needed.
2: If k is not specified, determine the optimal k using methods like the Elbow method or silhouette score.
3: Initialize centroids using an advanced method (k-means++).
4: Perform k-means clustering on D with distance metric M to identify clusters C1, C2, ..., Ck.
5: Compute the standard deviation σ(Ci) and density factor ρ(Ci) for each cluster Ci.
6: Initialize an empty anomaly set A.
7: For each data point x in D:
    7.1: Assign x to the nearest cluster Ci using distance metric M.
    7.2: Calculate the anomaly score A(x) = D(x, Ci) / (σ(Ci) + ε) × ρ(Ci).
    7.3: Determine a dynamic threshold T = α × median{A(D)} or a percentile-based threshold if α is not provided.
    7.4: If A(x) > T, append x to the anomaly set A.
8: Post-process the set A by applying domain-specific filters or a secondary machine learning model.
9: Return the refined anomaly set A.

#### Detailed Algorithm Description

1. **Preprocessing**: Ensures feature scaling does not unduly influence distance measurements.

2. **Optimal Clusters**: Critical for delineating normal data patterns, especially when k is unknown. Utilizes silhouette analysis for cases where clusters are not well separated.

3. **Initialization**: Mitigates the sensitivity of the k-means to initial centroid positions.

4. **Clustering**: The core step where the dataset is partitioned into k clusters based on the chosen metric \( M \), typically Euclidean distance, or Manhattan distance if the data is sparse or have non normal distributions.


5. **Standard Deviation and Density Factor**: These capture the spread and crowdedness of each cluster, essential for adjusting the anomaly score.

6. **Anomaly Identification**: The anomaly score considers both the distance of a point from the nearest cluster center and the relative density of that cluster.

7. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjusts the threshold for determining anomalies dynamically based on the median anomaly score of the data multiplied by an anomaly threshold factor \( α \), allowing adaptability to varying data distributions.

8. **Post-Processing**: Refines the anomaly set to mitigate false positives, crucial for practical applications. May include a consistency check or additional classifier.

9.  **Output**: The final output is a set of data points deemed to be anomalies based on the algorithm's criteria.

#### Threshold Strategy and Post-Processing

The threshold strategy adapts to the distribution of anomaly scores in the dataset. If \( α \) is not specified, the algorithm could use a percentile-based approach to dynamically define outliers. Post-processing involves cross-referencing anomalies against other data features or through a supplementary model trained to distinguish true anomalies from noise.

All steps are designed to work with standard outputs from SAS EM, such as cluster centroids and cluster spread measurements. The algorithm is robust to various initializations, thanks to advanced centroid initialization, and addresses the challenge of non-convex clusters with post-processing filters.
