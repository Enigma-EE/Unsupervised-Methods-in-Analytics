### Literature Review on Clustering-Based Anomaly Detection Methods

---

**Introduction**

Anomaly detection, a crucial step in data analysis, aims to identify data patterns that deviate significantly from the expected behavior. Clustering-based anomaly detection methods leverage the clustering process to detect outliers as points that do not conform to the pattern of any clusters. This literature review provides an organized overview of clustering-based anomaly detection methods, critically reviews key methodologies, and compares their effectiveness and applications.

**Overview of Clustering-Based Methods**

Clustering-based anomaly detection methods categorize data into clusters using various algorithms, with anomalies typically located far from the centroid of their nearest cluster or residing in sparse regions. These methods can be broadly classified into partition-based, density-based, and grid-based clustering techniques, each suited to different types of data distributions and applications (Chandola et al., 2009).

**Detailed Review of Methods**

1. **Hybrid Unsupervised Clustering-Based Anomaly Detection:**
   - Guo et al. (2021) introduced a hybrid method that combines Sub-Space Clustering (SSC) and One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to effectively detect anomalies in network traffic. SSC's ability to identify anomalies in data subspaces complements OCSVM's strength in classifying data points based solely on the "normal" instances. This hybrid approach was empirically validated using the NSL-KDD dataset, showcasing enhanced detection of both known and zero-day attacks (Guo et al., 2021 [1]).

2. **Unsupervised Scalable Multimodal Driving Anomaly Detection:**
   - Qiu et al. (2023) discussed unsupervised anomaly detection in intelligent vehicles. By introducing a scalable contrastive method, they address the challenge of detecting anomalies in the complex, multimodal domain of driving behavior. Their approach does not rely on labeled data, providing flexibility and adaptability to a wide range of driving anomalies, and exhibits scalability to integrate additional modalities, enhancing the detection process (Qiu et al., 2023 [2]).

3. **Unsupervised Multimodal Anomaly Detection for Datacenters:**
   - Zhao et al. (2020) focused on multimodal anomaly detection for failure prediction in datacenters. Their work underlines the significance of leveraging data from multiple sensors to predict hardware failures. The multimodal approach surpasses conventional threshold-based methods, allowing for the detection of complex patterns and providing an early warning system to preempt datacenter downtimes (Zhao et al., 2020 [3]).

**Comparison and Analysis**

Comparative analysis highlights that while traditional clustering methods are beneficial for anomaly detection, hybrid and multimodal techniques significantly advance the field. The hybrid method by Guo et al. (2021) offers a comprehensive solution for detecting both known and novel anomalies. In contrast, the methods by Qiu et al. (2023) and Zhao et al. (2020) demonstrate the efficacy of unsupervised and multimodal approaches in dealing with high-dimensional and complex data structures.

**Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Hybrid and multimodal methods provide robustness against novel anomalies, flexibility in handling various data types, and adaptability to new scenarios without the need for labeled data.
- **Cons:** Such advanced methods may require more computational resources and can be challenging to interpret due to their complex nature.

**Similarities and Differences:**
- **Similarities:** All reviewed methods aim to improve anomaly detection without relying on predefined labels, showcasing the strength of unsupervised learning.
- **Differences:** The methods diverge in their approach to data complexity; while the hybrid method integrates two distinct algorithms, the multimodal approaches harness the synergy of different data sources.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, clustering-based anomaly detection methods have significantly evolved to address complex and high-dimensional datasets. Hybrid and multimodal methods are at the forefront, offering promising results in diverse application domains, from network security to intelligent transportation systems and datacenter monitoring.

This method addresses the challenge of detecting anomalies in data with low-rank background and sparse anomalies. It incorporates data sphering to remove background components, uses unsupervised target detection to identify potential anomalies, and applies sparse cardinality to mitigate the influence of noise. This multifaceted approach is benchmarked against established methods such as LRaSR and AE-based techniques, showing a competitive edge in performance (Chen et al., 2022 [4]).

**Refining Unsupervised Learning for Anomaly Detection**

2. **Clustering-Based Methods on Shuttle Data:**
   - Shriram and Sivasankar (2019) delve into unsupervised learning techniques for anomaly detection on shuttle data. They categorize clustering-based methods into two streams: clustering with outliers and density-based approaches. The former includes methods like k-means and GMM, which isolate anomalies into separate clusters. The latter, represented by LOF and DBSCAN, assess the data density to pinpoint anomalies. These methods cater to situations where anomalies present with different densities and offer a choice of strategies based on the dataset characteristics (Shriram & Sivasankar, 2019 [5]).

**Comparative Analysis**

The DS-UTSSC method stands out for its application in hyperspectral data, dealing efficiently with its high-dimensional nature and improving the anomaly detection process. The method by Shriram and Sivasankar presents a comprehensive overview of clustering-based anomaly detection, emphasizing flexibility in approach and adaptability to data with varying density distributions.

**Pros and Cons**
- **Pros:** Both the DS-UTSSC and the clustering methods for shuttle data utilize unsupervised learning, allowing them to operate without labeled data and adapting to various types of anomalies.
- **Cons:** These methods may face challenges with interpretability and require careful tuning to balance the trade-off between anomaly detection sensitivity and specificity.

**Similarities and Differences**
- **Similarities:** Both methods focus on enhancing anomaly detection using clustering-based approaches without the need for labeled data, thus relying on the inherent structure of the data.
- **Differences:** The DS-UTSSC method is specialized for hyperspectral data, whereas the methods discussed by Shriram and Sivasankar are more generalizable to different types of datasets.

**Conclusion**

The examination of these advanced clustering-based anomaly detection methods reveals a progressive trend towards specialized techniques for different data types and scenarios. The DS-UTSSC offers a significant contribution to hyperspectral anomaly detection, while the clustering methods for shuttle data provide a broader set of tools for anomaly detection across various contexts.
