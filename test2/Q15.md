\[ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \]


\[ x = 450, \mu = 501, \sigma = 15 \]


\[ z = \frac{450 - 501}{15} \]
\[ z = \frac{-51}{15} \]
\[ z = -3.4 \]

A z-score of -3.4 means \( x \) is 3.4 standard deviations below the mean.

As a rule of thumb:
- A z-score with an absolute value greater than 2 is often considered unusual.
- A z-score with an absolute value greater than 3 is generally considered an outlier.

Since the absolute value of our z-score is 3.4, which is greater than 3, \( x = 450 \) is considered an outlier in the given dataset.
