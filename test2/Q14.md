### (a) Find all frequent itemsets using Apriori with minimum support 60%

- Generate 1-item candidate itemsets. Count occurrences for each item.
  
| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| Q    | 6     |
| L    | 3     |
| M    | 4     |
| N    | 4     |
| J    | 1     |
| K    | 4     |
| O    | 4     |
| P    | 2     |

- Prune and generate frequent 1-item itemsets.

- With a total of 6 transactions, 60% of 6 is 3.6, so use a minimum support of 4 transactions.

- Frequent 1-item itemsets:

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| Q    | 6     |
| M    | 4     |
| N    | 4     |
| K    | 4     |
| O    | 4     |

- Generate 2-item candidate itemsets

- pair up the frequent 1-item itemsets.

| Pair | Count |
|------|-------|
| Q,M  | 3     |
| Q,N  | 3     |
| Q,K  | 3     |
| Q,O  | 4     |
| M,N  | 3     |
| M,K  | 2     |
| M,O  | 1     |
| N,K  | 2     |
| N,O  | 2     |
| K,O  | 2     |

- Prune and generate frequent 2-item itemsets.

- Frequent 2-item itemsets:

| Pair | Count |
|------|-------|
| Q,M  | 3     |
| Q,N  | 3     |
| Q,K  | 3     |
| Q,O  | 4     |
| M,N  | 3     |

- Generate 3-item candidate itemsets.

- Based on frequent 2-item sets.

| Triple | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Q,M,N  | 2     |
| Q,M,K  | 1     |
| Q,M,O  | 2     |
| Q,N,K  | 2     |
| Q,N,O  | 2     |
| Q,K,O  | 2     |
| M,N,K  | 1     |
| M,N,O  | 1     |

- Prune.
- No 3-item candidate itemsets have the minimum support of 4.


**Final frequent itemsets:**
- 1-item: Q, M, N, K, O
- 2-item: Q,M; Q,N; Q,K; Q,O; M,N

---


### (b) Find association rules with minimum confidence 83%

- Generate association rules from frequent 2-item itemsets.

Using the formula: 
\[ \text{Confidence}(X \rightarrow Y) = \frac{\text{Support}(X \cup Y)}{\text{Support}(X)} \]

Rules and their confidence:

1. Q → M: 3/6 = 50%
2. M → Q: 3/4 = 75%
3. Q → N: 3/6 = 50%
4. N → Q: 3/4 = 75%
5. Q → K: 3/6 = 50%
6. K → Q: 3/4 = 75%
7. Q → O: 4/6 = 66.67%
8. O → Q: 4/6 = 66.67%
9. M → N: 3/4 = 75%
10. N → M: 3/4 = 75%

- Prune.

- No association rule has a confidence ≥ 83%.

Thus, no association rules are found with the given threshold.
